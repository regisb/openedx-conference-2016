                    <aside>
                        Hi everyone! I'm Régis and I work as a software engineer for a large open edx-based platform that provides more than 300 courses to 800k users. I'm extremely happy to be here, really. I love Open edX: the community is fantastic, the conference is a lot of fun. The project has a purpose that I relate with, which is to bring education to 1 billion people. If you are a software engineer and you are working in a bank or an advertising company, I'm telling you: there is a way out. 

                        Ok who is a software engineer in the room? And who is a python developer? (Python developer, as in: you have written 1k lines of python code) How many are django developers? (as in: you have contributed to a Django project at some point) That's great. For the others: it's okay, the world needs you, too. Some parts of this presentation are going to be difficult to follow but you can watch it again later on youtube and the slides will be made available online at this address. (TODO include address)
                        
                        And the Open edX source code is great, too. The thing is, even after almost two years working on Open edX-code, there are still parts of the source code that remain mysterious and actually quite difficult to understand. And I believe many developers 
                        
                        Hi everyone! My name is Régis and I work as a software engineer for the French ministry of higher education to develop a platform called FUN which provides free, open online courses to everyone. FUN is based on Open edX and it's a pretty big project with more than 800k users and 300 courses. (TODO check these numbers) With such a large project, we often have to dive deep into the source code of Open edX to develop new features, modify existing features or simply to debug issues. The documentation of Open edX is pretty good, in my opinion, especially for a project that big and with so frequent updates. Yet, most of the documentation covers the general architecture of Open edX and it doesn't really go deep inside the APIs of the different Open edX components -- but that's not the point of a project documentation anyway. As a developer, I'm pretty much a bottom-to-top kind of guy. I need to understand how the components work individually in order to understand how a project works as a whole. And this is the point of this presentation -- hopefully: to try to understand how

                        , for the next 30 minutes or so, we are going to read the source code of Open edX.</aside>

                    <aside>When I was first confronted with the Open edX source code, two years ago, that's when I joined the FUN project at the French ministry of higher education, well exploring the Open edX source code was pretty hard. I was already a senior python and django developer, so I was familiar with the architecture of a standard django project, and some non-standard django projects as well. The Open edX documentation is really good, especially for a project that large. Yet there were many surprises along the way, as I explored the different modules to develop new features or resolve weird bugs. 

                        What I tried to do in this presentation is to explore the important pieces of code that make up the Open edX project. Now I need to give you a word of warning here: I have been an Open edX developer since 2014; that's three full years after the first commit to edx-platform was made.

                        I have made a couple contributions to Open edX, but nothing major; I'm part of the Open edX community, but I don't work at edX. What I mean is that there is a probability that I say very wrong things about Open edX here, and that probability is much bigger than zero. If you spot a mistake, please tell me about it in the question session or later; the slides will be available on the internet and I will update them to include your comments.

                    <h3>Open edX from above</h3>
                    <aside>
    Alright, let's get started. In order to make this presentation, I did what most developers do when they first start hacking on Open edX: I downloaded a virtual machine containing the latest stable release of Open edX. Everything we say from now on will be about dogwood.3.

    Before we dive deep into the Open edX source code, what I would like to do now is to try to give us an overview of how exactly the Open edX source code is organized.

    Here is the list of folders that contain major Open edX repositories.

    As we can see, it's wrong to assume that Open edX consists of a single code repository. There are mandatory repositories, such as edx-platform and its dependencies from the virtual environment; there is a theming repo that you may wish to create and install yourselves. The forum repository is pretty much mandatory as well, if you wish to provide your users a discussion service. And there are optional ecommerce repositories, which you don't need if your platform does not offer paying products.

                    Let's take a look at the first repository listed here. edx-platform is actually the biggest code repository that is necessary to run Open edX. But how big is it? Let me do a quick survey here: how many lines of code do you think there are in edx-platform? I'm talking about actual code: not comments, not blank lines and not vendor dependencies (but test code is included).

                    <aside>edx-platform contains 427k lines of code. Outside of python itself, as far as I know, this is the largest python project that fits in a single repository. edx-platform is twice as big as Django. And that's just for edx-platform; as I mentioned, edx-platform is one of many Open edX repositories. I can't emphasize this enough: Open edX is really big.
                        
    Why is that important? Well it's important for me. When I submitted this talk and started working on the presentation, my ambition was to go through most parts of the source code and highlight the best pieces I found. But with that much code, this approach just wasn't feasible. In fact, a lot of the code that you are going to find in Open edX is more-or-less standard Django code. What I would like to talk about in this presentation is the code that is non-standard, tricky or difficult to grasp. To do that, we need to understand what edx-platform is made of. Let's take a look how the edx-platform code is organised, physically speaking.</aside>

                    <h3>Inside edx-platform</h3>
                    <aside>edx-platform is mostly made of Python, javascript, html and css code. That's not surprising at all for a large web project. Those of you that have worked with Open edX before know that running a server requires a rather long preliminary phase for compiling javascript and css code. This compile time is caused by the 13% of SASS and the Coffeescript code. Now let's take a closer look at how this code is organized.</aside>

                        <aside>In this sunburst ring graph, we have plotted the different components of edx-platform. The number of lines of code of each component is proportional to its angular range. The further we go from the center, the deeper we go in the folder structure of the repository. We can see that the edx-platform code is rather well separated in modular components. The lms and the cms are clearly visible; if you've never run Open edX before: edx-platform is not one single django project, but more like two distinct django projects with some common code, stored in the common and openedx folders, here and there.

    We can spot a lot of javascript code, but also a lot of test code, including in the javascript folders, which is comforting.
                            
    The LMS is the django project provided to the students; the CMS is used by the course staff to design and administer their courses. As we can see, the LMS-specific code is much more complex than the CMS-specific code. Note however that the code common to both the LMS and the CMS is very large as well; almost as large as the LMS-specific code. The LMS is made of many different django applications, the largest of which is the courseware, which is in charge of displaying a course to a user. On the other hand, the CMS is almost entirely made of one single big django application, called the contentstore. The common code contains a variety of application, but there is one library that stands out very clearly. The xmodule package is simply huge. At more than 65k lines of code, it can be considered as a very big python project in its own right.

                    <aside>Here we compare edx-platform with other Open edX repositories that are included in the devstack. The largest of them is the cs_comments_service project, written in ruby. It provides an HTTP API that edx-platform connects to in order to display the forums in the LMS. The ecommerce repository is for selling products on Open edX: it's large but it hasn't been created specifically for Open edX. Then there is the virtual environment that contains all the edx-platform dependencies</aside>

                    <aside>The virtual environment contains quite a few packages. Here I listed a few of the Open edx-specific repositories. There are many xblocks, such as the recommender-xblock, edx-sga and edx-jsme (the molecular editor). Most of these xblocks clock at about 2k to 3k lines of code, which tells us that it's not so complex to create an xblock. What is impressive here is the size of the ora2 repository, for peer-assessed exams. We'll come back to that later.</aside>

                    <aside>We have spent a lot of time counting lines of code in Open edX and that has been a bit tedious, sorry about that. Yet I feel it has been necessary in order to understand where the complexity lies in the project. We have seen the places where most code is written, and as we explore Open edX code, we can expect to pay a visit to these places. Now what I would like to do is take a specific view, in the django sense, and see where it goes. This should tell us something about how the sausage is made.</aside>

What we observe is that a course is represented by an instance of CourseDescriptorWithMixins. There is something surprising about that, even for experienced django developers. Actually, the CourseDescriptorWithMixins is not declared in the internal module of the xblock package. You can go take a look there, you won't find anything. In fact, the CourseDescriptorWithMixins class is not declared anywhere. Let's go back to the list of base classes of the course object to understand what is happening here.</aside>

                    <h3>Btw, what is a mixin?</h3>
                    <aside>Before we go any further, I'm not sure everyone knows what a mixin is. Quick survey: who knows exactly what a mixin is? It's a notion that is very popular in Python, but not so much in some other languages. Come on, don't be shy. Ok I'll give you the definition by wikipedia. 
                        
                        This definition is a bit abstract, so let's see an example. Shape is a class that can serve as the base class of many different classes ; for instance, the Square class, and the Triangle class. All these shapes share a common method, the perimeter method which computes the sum of the lengths of the shape edges. Now let's say we need a colored shape : a shape with color. Applying colors is a neat feature, but not every class needs it. For instance, we only need colored squares, but not colored triangles. We definitely don't want to bloat the definition of triangles with a useless colorize method. So we create a ColorMixin that defines the colorize feature; note that the ColorMixin does not work by itself, because it has no edges attribute. Then the ColoredSquare class inherits from both the Square class and the ColorMixin class and exhibits properties from both worlds.
                    
                        ...
                        Ok, did that make it clear what a mixin is? In brief, a mixin is a class that provides a piece of functionality. It's like an interface, but with some partially-defined methods. 

                        Some say that the world of developers is divided in two categories: those who hate Mixins and those who abuse them.

                        Ok let's return to the course descriptor.

Ok let's talk about xblocks. Now I know this is the Open edX conference; certainly, many of you are very familiar with the concept of xblocks. Who knows what an xblock is? 
                    
                    That's a lot of people / Fewer than I expected.
                
Those of you who know what an xblock is, let me ask you: who knows how an XBlock is instantiated in Open edX? In other words, how do you create an XBlock instance?
                
Much less people, that's what I was hoping for, to be honest / Wow that's a lot of people. Well I'll show the next slides anyway, for posterity.
/ Wow, that's a lot. Yes, the runtime instantiates xblocks. Ok, bonus question: are you sure? As we'll see, it's a bit more complicated.

                    <h3>XBlocks from the inside</h3>
                    <aside>There are many tutorials and videos that explain what xblocks are, from a 10k meter view. Here are two videos that I think really stand out with their clarity. Both include explanations by Ned Batchelder. Usually, xblocks are described as the building blocks of a course: a course is an xblock that contains other xblocks. It's "xblocks all the way down" as Ned says. Videos are instances of xblocks, and so are polls, peer assessed exams, and many others: all the components of a course are xblock instances. There are hundreds of different kinds of xblocks that you can mish mash together to build interesting, fun, interactive courses.

                    There is the xblock directory located at xblocks.org. Don't go to xblocks.com, that's a website for quilting. It would make things even more confusing.

                    <h3>XBlocks from the inside</h3>

                    <aside>
Let's analyse an XBlock! For this presentation I selected xblock-poll, which was developed at opencraft. It's clean and concise, with just about 1k lines of python code. Note that for the sake of conciseness, some portions of code have been rewritten. The PollBlock class declares a student_view. There is also a studio_view, which is not indicated here because it does pretty much the same thing as the student_view. The student view method returns a fragment, which is simply a piece of html code that may include references to css or js resources.

What is more interesting is the declaration of fields associated to the xblock. In order to actually do something, the xblock needs to have some data attached. This data is declared as fields. These fields remind us of fields associated to a django model class. But actually, django model fields and xblock fields are completely different things. In django, field values are associated to a model instance by the metaclass of the model. In xblocks, the fields are associated to an xblock instance. All this is very abstract, and honestly it's not too important; just remember one thing: xblock fields look similar to django model fields, but actually they are completely different things.

Note that a scope is associated to each field. We'll come back to that later.

This xblock also has associated methods. In one of them, we access the 'settings' service from the xblock runtime. The 'settings' service was demanded by the xblock as a decorator of the PollBlock class. We still haven't explained what a runtime is, but we can already say that it is supposed to provide services to xblocks. In fact, runtimes have multiple responsibilities.

                    <h3>XBlock runtimes</h3>
                    <aside>Let's cut to the chase: a runtime is also in charge of instantiating xblocks. As we can see, a runtime needs to be passed to the xblock constructor. In practice, the runtime passes itself to the new xblock instances.
                        
                        Now, like we said, runtimes also provide services to Xblocks. Services can be just about anything. 
                        
                        The call to 'service' returns an object on which the xblock is free to call just any function.
                        
TODO how to create a new service and add it to the LMS? and why should we do it?
Actually, xblock developers are encouraged to make use of runtime services instead of importing modules from the edx-platform repository. Remember: xblocks are supposed to be portable and not implementation-specific. They declare to the runtime the services that they require, via the 'needs' and 'wants' decorators. 

                        In particular, there exists a service in charge of reading and writing xblock field data. Let's take a look at that service.

                    <aside>The XBlock class inherits from the ScopedStorageMixin, which itself needs the field-data service. The 'field-data' service is expected to expose a `set_many` method that can be used to save xblock instances. This is for writing xblock data. What about reading xblock data? This is performed inside the Field class. Each field attribute reads into the field_data of the xblock -- in other words, the field-data service from the runtime. Then, the methods has and get are executed. Actually, the field data service is pretty straightforward. The field-data service is only supposed to implement the FieldData interface.

                    <h2>XBlock storage</h2>
                    <aside>The field data service that is used in the LMS is called LmsFieldData and here we have the definition of the constructor of the LmsFieldData class. We have a similar class in the CMS, called CmsFieldData, with an almost identical definition. As we can see, the LMS field data has two different policies for storing xblock fields, depending on the xblock scope. But what is the scope of an xblock? I mentioned that there are different possible scopes for the fields of an XBlock.for the fields of an XBlock. Remember the scope associated to each field from the polling xblock? The scope of an xblock field defines the set of xblock instances over which the field takes the same value. For instance, the 'choice' field of the polling xblock is specific to each user and each xblock instance. On the other hand the 'answers' field is the list of possible answers for this xblock.

The LmsFieldData has two different storage strategies for the authored_data and the student_data. Authored data is data produced by course authors, while student data is data produced by students. You may have heard that student data is stored in MySQL while course data is stored in MongoDb, and this comes from this definition of the LmsFieldData and the CmsFieldData services. But where exactly are student_data and authored_data defined? We have to dig deep in order to discover the definition of authored_data and student_data. 
<!--We can see that they are stored differently, but how? authored_data is in fact a MongoKeyValueStore. We can see that authored data is stored in MongoDb instead of MySQL.-->

                    <aside>If you remember correctly, we started investigating xblocks, runtimes and field data service because of a comment from the settings module. That comment had sparked a number of questions. I believe we have answered the first two. But what's the connection with the modulestore? This is actually a pretty important question -- and a difficult one, too. To be honest, I didn't know the answer to that question before I started working on this presentation. I'll try to be clear and concise.</aside>

                <aside>As we can see, student data is stored in a key-value store managed by django. DjangoKeyValueStore is not very interesting to look at; all the intelligence is in field_data_cache. What about authored_data? authored_data is descriptor._field_data. And the storage of this data is installation-dependent. Itis configured by a setting called MODULESTORE. If you use the default Open edX settings, then you are using a MixedModuleStore that can point to multiple modulestores: a Draft Modulestore, a SplitMongo Versioned Draft Modulestore or an XML Modulestorestore. You can even use multiple modulestores at the same time.
                    
                    To summarize: in Open edX, while xblocks are not bound to a user, they are actually XModuleDescriptor. They do not contain any user-specific data, just authored data, which is stored inside a modulestore configured by the MODULESTORE variable. But once an xblock becomes attached to a user, the field_data that is used is a django, SQL-based Key-value store. Pfiouh, that was hard.</aside>

                    <h2>The LMS/CMS runtimes</h2>
                    <aside>The LMS and the CMS each define a different runtime, which is not so surprising, because xblocks need to use different services and rendering functions in the lms and in the cms. The LMS runtime is defined in the lms_xblock application. It's called the LmsModuleSystem, and it inherits from the ModuleSystem class. The runtime of the CMS is located in the contentstore of the cms, and it's called the PreviewModuleSystem. It also inherits from the ModuleSystem. But what is the ModuleSystem? The ModuleSystem is defined in the xmodule application and inherits from the xblock Runtime class. 
                        
                        <!--Now we begin to understand why the xmodule application is so large. Perhaps you remember that the xmodule package counts more than 65k lines of code. And it's pretty natural, considering it contains the definition of the CourseDescriptor class, the definition of many course components, both the Open edX runtimes and the definition of multiple modulestores.-->
                    
Actually, in Open edX, the modulestore is in charge of loading the xblocks. Because of historical reasons, open edx needs to manipulate XModules, not xblocks. What are XModules? Xmodules are created from XModuledescriptors, which are not bound to a student. To make things even more complicated, XModuleDescriptor inherit from XBlock, although they are not bound to a student. The binding is done by the bind_for_student method of the XModule class. Again, this is very complex stuff, and not 100% necessary to understand. Let's just remember that Open edX creates a glue to make old XModules compatible with modern XBlocks. But still, we'd like to know where our stuff is stored! 


xmodule/xmodule/x_module.py

@XBlock.needs("i18n")
class XModuleDescriptor(HTMLSnippet, ResourceTemplates, XModuleMixin):
    """
    An XModuleDescriptor is a specification for an element of a course. This
    could be a problem, an organizational element (a group of content), or a
    segment of video, for example.

    XModuleDescriptors are independent and agnostic to the current student state
    on a problem. They handle the editing interface used by instructors to
    create a problem, and can generate XModules (which do know about student
    state).
    """
    ...
                    
class XModuleMixin(XModuleFields, XBlock):
    
    def bind_for_student(self, xmodule_runtime, user_id, wrappers=None):
        """

        Arguments:
            xmodule_runtime (:class:`ModuleSystem'): the runtime to use when accessing student facing methods
            user_id: The user_id to set in scope_ids

                      which they're listed. So [f1, f2] -> f2(f1(field_data))
